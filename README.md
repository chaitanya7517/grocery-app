Grocery Application – Microservices Backend
Overview

Designed and developed a scalable grocery application backend using a microservices architecture. The system supports secure user authentication, order management, and service-to-service communication through an API Gateway, ensuring modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance.

Key Contributions

Developed a pure backend application supporting user signup and login with secure authentication and authorization.

Designed and implemented a microservices architecture, separating core functionalities into independent services.

Built an API Gateway to handle request routing, authentication, and communication between client and backend services.

Implemented a User Service to manage user registration, login, and profile-related operations.

Developed an Order Service to handle grocery order creation, order tracking, and order lifecycle management.

Ensured loose coupling and high cohesion between services to improve scalability and fault isolation.

Implemented RESTful APIs with proper request validation, error handling, and standardized response structures.

Improved backend reliability and maintainability by following industry best practices for service design and API development.
